# üß† XOPT ‚Äî INTERPRETABLE METAHEURISTICS FOR COMBINATORIAL OPTIMIZATION

## üìò Introduction

This repository contains research and experimental results on the **interpretability of metaheuristic algorithms** applied to **combinatorial optimization problems**. The goal is to **analyze, explain, and visualize** the decision-making processes behind heuristic search methods, **bridging the gap between performance and transparency**.

This work explores how metaheuristics such as **Genetic Algorithms**, **Tabu Search**, and other heuristic-based optimization techniques can be interpreted to gain insight into their internal search dynamics, convergence patterns, and decision rationale. By improving the **explainability** of these algorithms, we aim to better understand *why* and *how* they reach certain solutions, contributing to more transparent and trustworthy optimization systems.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Research Context

Metaheuristics are powerful optimization tools capable of finding near-optimal solutions to complex **combinatorial problems**. However, their stochastic and adaptive nature often turns them into *black boxes*. This research seeks to provide **interpretability frameworks** to uncover their underlying mechanisms ‚Äî identifying key features, search trajectories, and decision influences that drive solution quality.

Applications include:
- P-median and facility location problems  
- Optimization problems where interpretability and decision transparency are relevant
